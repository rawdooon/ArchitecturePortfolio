                    I always had a dream to become a famous architect and implant buildings of my designs  in different countries all over the world,
                    but i figured out that pursuing this dream is like making castles in the air, because it requires a huge amount of experience which i can't actually amass,
                    due to my circumstances of being a syrian citizen who lives in a country which never cares about architectural and urban design, and has the worst level
                    of architectural education at university in the world, as well as the low salary that architects earn not only in Syria but all across the world in comparison with programmers.
                    And while IT's future is becoming more and more amazing, especially for new learners, and their salaries are also higher, and the demand for programmers
                    is always higher than other fields of study, so I decided to keep architecture as a hobby and move to IT as my future profession.
